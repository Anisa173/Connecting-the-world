    <p>
      Tolui (c. 1191–1232) was the youngest son of Genghis Khan and his wife
      Börte. A prominent general during the early Mongol conquests, Tolui was a
      leading candidate to succeed his father after his death in 1227 and
      ultimately served as regent of the Mongol Empire until the accession of
      his brother Ögedei two years later. Tolui's wife was Sorghaghtani Beki;
      their sons included Möngke and Kublai, the fourth and fifth khagans of the
      empire, and Hulagu, the founder of the Ilkhanate.
    </p>
    <p>
      Tolui was less active than his elder brothers Jochi, Chagatai, and Ögedei
      during their father's rise to power, but once he reached adulthood he was
      considered the finest warrior of the four. He commanded armies under his
      father during the first invasion of Jin China (1211–1215), and his
      distinguished service during the Mongol invasion of the Khwarazmian Empire
      secured his reputation. After the fall of the cities of Transoxiana in
      1220, Genghis dispatched Tolui early the following year to subjugate the
      region of Khorasan, which had begun to cause trouble for the Mongol
      armies. Tolui executed his orders with ruthless efficiency, assaulting the
      major cities of Merv, Nishapur, and Herat, and subjugating numerous
      others. Medieval chroniclers attributed more than three million deaths to
      the massacres he ordered at Nishapur and Merv; while these figures are
      considered exaggerated by modern historians, they are evidence of the
      abnormal brutality of Tolui's campaign.
    </p>
    <p>
      As the Mongols' traditional inheritance system was a form of
      ultimogeniture, Tolui was always a leading candidate to succeed his
      father. His position was strengthened by the elimination of Jochi and
      Chagatai, on account of possible illegitimacy and excessive arrogance
      respectively. Genghis eventually passed Tolui over in favour of Ögedei,
      who was known for his generosity. Tolui was on his father's last campaign
      when the latter died in mid-1227; as the youngest son, he became regent,
      in charge of his father's burial and the administration of the nation. It
      is possible that the two-year interregnum was lengthened by Tolui's desire
      to become khan himself; he nevertheless eventually swore allegiance to
      Ögedei, who was crowned in 1229.
    </p>
    <p>
      Tolui accompanied Ögedei after the resumption of warfare against the Jin
      dynasty in 1230. The campaign was successful and they returned home to
      Mongolia two years later. That year, Tolui died in unclear circumstances.
      The official record was that he died during a shamanic ritual while saving
      Ögedei from a curse; alternative theories suggest that he died from
      alcoholism or that Ögedei had him poisoned. Having taken over Tolui's
      lands and estates after his death, Sorghaghtani amassed enough wealth and
      supporters to ensure that her son Möngke took power in 1251, after the
      death of Ögedei's son Güyük.

    <h2>Life</h2>
    <h3>Life under Genghis (c. 1191–1227)</h3>
    <p>
      The year of Tolui's birth is disputed; while the historian Christopher
      Atwood believes he was born in 1191 or 1192,[2] the sinologists Frederick
      W. Mote and Paul Ratchnevsky placed the date in the late 1180s.[3] He was
      the fourth son of Temüjin, the future Genghis Khan, and Börte, Temüjin's
      first wife; his elder brothers were Jochi (b. c. 1184), Chagatai
      (b. c. 1185), and Ögedei (b. c. 1186).[4] He also had five full sisters—in
      order of birth, these were Qojin, Chechiyegen, Alaqa, Tumelun, and
      Altun.[5] The name "Tolui" (Mongolian script: ᠲᠤᠯᠤᠢ, Mongolian: Толуй,
      meaning 'mirror') has also been transliterated to English as Toli and
      Tuluy, among other spellings.[6] The historian Isenbike Togan has
      speculated that "Tolui" was a title which Genghis intended to replace the
      pre-imperial epithet otchigin, traditionally given to the youngest son.[7]
