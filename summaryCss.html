        Epcot, stylized in all uppercase as EPCOT, is a theme park at the Walt
        Disney World Resort in Bay Lake, Florida. It is owned and operated by
        The Walt Disney Company through its Experiences division. Inspired by an
        unrealized concept of the same name developed by Walt Disney, the park
        opened on October 1, 1982, as EPCOT Center, and was the second of four
        theme parks built at Walt Disney World. The park spans 305 acres, more
        than twice the size of Magic Kingdom. Often referred to as a "permanent
        world's fair", Epcot is dedicated to the celebration of human
        achievement, particularly technological innovation and international
        culture.
